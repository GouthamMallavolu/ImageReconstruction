Week 5 – Webcam Demo, API Updates & Final Polishing

* Added a live webcam reconstruction demo.
* Updated to the latest streamlit-webrtc API (avoid deprecation spam).
* Polished evaluation, training, and UI for final project delivery.

* Implemented webcam mode in the UI using streamlit-webrtc:
    * At first used VideoTransformerBase + transform():
        * Triggered deprecation warnings:
            * video_transformer_factory is deprecated
            * transform() is deprecated. Implement recv() instead.
    * Updated to the new API:
        * Switched to VideoProcessorBase.
        * Implemented recv():

* Fine-tuned README / documentation:
    * Added:
        * Project description.
        * Environment setup steps.
        * How to train, evaluate, and run the UI.
        * Explanation of metrics and architecture.

Challenges Faced:
* Webcam mode is more demanding and depends on:
    * Working streamlit-webrtc.
    * av package.
    * Browser permissions for camera.
* Reconstruction quality is still bounded by:
    * Small decoder capacity (by design).
    * Frozen encoder not optimized specifically for reconstruction.

Final Results:
* Final end-to-end system:
    * Training (train.py) with advanced loss and fine-tuning.
    * Evaluation (evaluate.py) with detailed metrics and plots.
    * Testing (test_model.py) for spot-checking reconstructions.
    * UI (ui_app.py) with:
        * Image upload reconstruction.
        * Live webcam reconstruction.
    * Interactive demo via Streamlit.
